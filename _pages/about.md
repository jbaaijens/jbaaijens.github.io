Welcome! I am a mathematician turned bioinformatician working on genome reconstruction and analysis for viruses and bacteria. More specifically, I develop algorithms and software for reconstruction of microbial genomes from sequencing data, and then apply these methods to characterize pathogen diversity in patient or community samples. See [research](https://jbaaijens.github.io/research/), [publications](https://jbaaijens.github.io/publications/) and [talks](https://jbaaijens.github.io/talks/) for further details, or read about my work on viral genome assembly at the popular science platforms [Kennislink](https://www.nemokennislink.nl/publicaties/hoe-wiskunde-helpt-in-de-strijd-tegen-ziekmakende-virussen/) and [C2W](https://www.c2w.nl/artikelen/chemie-achtergrond/grafentheorie-brengt-virus-in-kaart) (both in Dutch).

After completing my MSc degree in mathematics, I started my PhD research in viral genomics at the [Dutch institute for mathematics and computer science (CWI)](). For postdoctoral research, I spent two years in [the Baym lab](https://baymlab.hms.harvard.edu) at Harvard Medical School to extend my expertise to bacterial genomics. In September 2021, I joined [the Bioinformatics Lab](https://www.tudelft.nl/index.php?id=24108) at TU Delft as an assistant professor and I am looking forward to further collaborations with theoretical as well as experimental research groups interested in microbial genomics and pathogen surveillance.
